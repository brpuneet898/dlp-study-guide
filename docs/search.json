    "text": "Hugging Face has proven to be an indispensable tool in the artificial intelligence (AI) domain. It has paved a long way, evolving from a niche-specific chatbot startup into a $4.5 billion open-source powerhouse and delivering access to machine learning, deep learning, and other associated domains. It was founded sometime around 2016. Initially, the company started as a chatbot app that used to target teenagers to provide emotional support via an AI BFF (Best Friend Forever). Soon enough, the founders realized that it had a lot of potential than just being used as a chatbot. They found the underlying principle of natural language processing (NLP) technology. Finally, open-sourced in 2018, they started building a collaborative environment for AI/ML development. This decision led them to become the major leader in the ML ecosystem.

    "text": "Usage of Hugging Face and Best Practices\nAs discussed, Hugging Face is called the GitHub of Machine Learning. It offers around 300,000+ pre-trained models, 50,000+ datasets, number of tools to build or deploy your AI applications. These customizable models and datasets can be trained and tested for various domains. There are several open-source libraries like transformers (specifically designed for Natural Language Processing - this will be highly used in our course work from Week 1 to 4), diffusers (designed for image generation), datasets (download datasets directly by specifying the URL and intended sub-parts). They collectively help us in working with modern AI architectures like BERT, GPT, and stable diffusion.\nKey Components -\n\nModels: Pre-trained architectures like BERT, GPT, and Diffusion for NLP, vision, and audio tasks. Ready to download and use. Please note some of the models are gated, they require special permissions from the owners. For eg. meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B\nDatasets: Curated and clean data ready for training or evaluation. We will learn in the next module how to download and play with the datasets.\nSpaces: Host ML demos using Gradio or Streamlit. Not very relevant for this particular course, but highly recommended for real-life industrial applications.\nInference API: Serverless and seamless experience in model testing.\n\nSetup for Deployment\n1. VS Code\n\nInstall Hugging Face VS Code Extension\nConfigure API token:\n\n## In VS Code command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P):\n# Hugging Face Code: Set API Token\n\nUse code autocompletion with StarCoder/Codellama\n\n2. Google Colab\n\n## Install core libraries\n# !pip install transformers datasets huggingface_hub\n\n## Authenticate\n# from huggingface_hub import notebook_login\n# notebook_login()  # Follow token prompt\n\n3. CLI in Token Management\n\nCreate token at hf.co/settings/tokens\nTerminal login:\n\n# huggingface-cli login\n## Enter token when prompted\n\nUse in Python:\n\n\n# from huggingface_hub import login\n# login(token=\"hf_yourtoken\")  # For script authentication\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nModel Selection\n\n\nFilter by task/library/dataset on Model Hub\nCheck model cards for license/compute requirements\n\n\nResource Management\n\n\nUse fp16 precision: model.half()\nLeverage model parallelism for large models\n\n\nReproducibility\n\n\n# from transformers import set_seed\n# set_seed(42)  # Across all ML libraries\n\n\nProduction Deployment\n\n\nConvert models to ONNX/TensorRT\nUse Inference Endpoints for scalable serving\n\n\nConvention used in our study guide -\n\n\n# (Single hash): Executable code (uncomment to use)\n## (Double hash): Explanatory comments",
